# [Reddit Archive](https://dacuteraccoon.github.io/reddit/)
I made this on my personal computer, so we can all browse Reddit on our work computer, assuming Reddit is blocked.
# About
This site uses [pushshift](https://pushshift.io/) to view Reddit without actually using Reddit, as well as browsing banned subreddits and user profiles.
Pushshift does not store scores for many submissions and comments, so sorting by score will often not give you the results you want. Sorting by Comments might be preferable.
For really old threads, it is not possible to recreate the threads with all the comments. E.g. http://dacuteraccoon.github.io/reddit/index.html?comments=2aa52s. Here no comments will show. There is nothing that can be done about that.
___
The **search** form allows you to use special characters to enable better searching.
<br/>
**Subreddit** allows you to seperate multiple subreddits using commas. To exclude a subreddit from your search, use !
<br/>
Same applies to the **Author** field.
<br/>
**Size** defines how many results you want to see. By default, it will look for 100 posts at a time, and it can go up to a maximum of 1000.
<br/>
**Score** and **Number of Comments** allows for the use of <, >, <=, >= to manually paginate through the results.
